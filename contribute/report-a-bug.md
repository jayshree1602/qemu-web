Bugs can be filed at our [bug tracker](https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/), which is hosted on Launchpad.

When submitting a bug report, please try to do the following:

* Make sure you're reporting the bug against the [latest release](/download/#source).  If possible, please try to reproduce with the latest development tree too.

* Include the full command line used to launch the QEMU guest.

* Reproduce the problem directly with a QEMU command-line.  Avoid frontends and management stacks, to ensure that the bug is in QEMU itself and not in a frontend.

* Include as information about the guest (operating system, version, 32/64-bit).

* Do not contribute patches on the bug tracker; send patches to the mailing list. Follow QEMU's [guidelines about submitting patches](http://wiki.qemu.org/Contribute/SubmitAPatch).
